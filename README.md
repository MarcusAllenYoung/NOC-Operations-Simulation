# 🖥️ NOC Operations Simulation

> A physical NOC lab focused on network monitoring, incident response, troubleshooting, and ticket management.

## About the Project

This project documents the development of a physical network environment designed to simulate the operational responsibilities of an entry-level Network Operations Center (NOC) technician.

The lab is built using physical Cisco routing and switching infrastructure and will expand to include WAN connectivity, centralized network monitoring, logging, and ticket management. While the project begins with deploying and validating the network, its primary focus is using that infrastructure to practice realistic NOC incident response.

Once the environment is operational, controlled network failures will be introduced to generate realistic incidents. These incidents will be detected through monitoring alerts or simulated user reports and documented in Spiceworks as trouble tickets.

Each incident will require investigation, fault isolation, troubleshooting, escalation when appropriate, service restoration, validation, and ticket closure.

The goal is to practice supporting and troubleshooting an operational network, not simply building one.

## 🗺️ Project Roadmap

### [01 | Network Foundation 🏗️](https://github.com/MarcusAllenYoung/NOC-Operations-Simulation/blob/main/Network%20Foundation) Completed ✅

Build and validate the physical LAN before introducing outside connectivity.

**Focus:** VLAN segmentation, 802.1Q trunking, inter-VLAN routing, management access, device hardening, endpoint connectivity, and establishing a known-good network baseline.

---

### [02 | WAN & Internet Connectivity 🌐](https://github.com/MarcusAllenYoung/NOC-Operations-Lab/blob/main/WAN%20Integration%20%26%20Internet%20Services)

Extend LBR-001 beyond the internal network and establish external connectivity.

**Focus:** WAN integration, default routing, NAT/PAT, Internet connectivity, DNS testing, and WAN validation.

---

### [03 | Network Monitoring 📊](https://github.com/MarcusAllenYoung/NOC-Operations-Lab/blob/main/Network%20Monitoring%20%26%20Observability%20Deployment)

Introduce centralized visibility into the health and performance of the network.

**Focus:** LibreNMS, SNMP, syslog, device availability, interface monitoring, performance baselines, and alerting.

---

### [04 | Incident Response 🚨](https://github.com/MarcusAllenYoung/NOC-Operations-Lab/blob/main/NOC%20Incident%20Response%20%26%20Troubleshooting%20Operations)

Use the completed environment to simulate network incidents and operational troubleshooting.

**Focus:** Alert investigation, ticket creation, fault isolation, troubleshooting, ISP escalation, service restoration, and incident closure.

---

## 🔄 NOC Workflow

The completed environment will be used to practice a repeatable operational process:

**Monitor → Detect → Investigate → Ticket → Troubleshoot → Resolve/Escalate → Verify → Close**

Each incident will document:

- What was reported or detected
- What services or devices were affected
- Initial troubleshooting observations
- Tests performed
- Root cause
- Corrective action
- Verification of service restoration
- Final ticket resolution

## 🎯 Project Goal

The purpose of this project is to bridge the gap between networking knowledge and actually operating a network.

A working network is only the starting point. The completed lab will provide an environment where I can practice recognizing abnormal behavior, using monitoring data to investigate problems, troubleshooting across multiple layers of the network, communicating technical findings, and documenting incidents from detection through resolution.

The project will continue to evolve as new monitoring capabilities, troubleshooting scenarios, and infrastructure are introduced.
